      <h1>Lidar Distance over I2C</h1>

    <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p>
        This module acts as a sensor and provides a PID source that can be used
        within a PID Loop. This is useful for driving the robot to a target, aiming
        a shooting device, or determing position on the field of play.
      </p>
    <h2>What you have to do</h2>
    <p>
      In order to use this sensor, you will need to create a new class named LidarDistance_XXX where
      XXX is the name you gave it. This class will use
      the same Java namespace used in Robot.java. At a minimum, you will need a
      constructor, and pidGet methods. Here is the minimum code you will need:

package org.usfirst.frc5933.ubot;

import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.I2C;

public class LidarDistance {
  private I2C LidarDevice = null;
  private int deviceAddress = 0;
  private I2C.Port devicePort = I2C.Port.kOnboard;
  private boolean connected = false;

  public LidarDistance(I2C.Port port, int address) {
    deviceAddress = address;
    devicePort = port;
    LidarDevice = new I2C(devicePort, deviceAddress);
  }

  public boolean connect() {
    connected = !LidarDevice.addressOnly();
    return connected;
  }

  public boolean isConnected() {
     return connected;
  }

  public double pidGet() {
    // TODO: Fill this is with an appropriate value ranging from -1 to 1.
    return 0;
  }
