# robotbuilder_extensions

RobotBuilder works very well for creating robot programs that just use WPILib for motors, controllers, and sensors. But for teams that use custom classes, RobotBuilder doesn't have any support for those classes, so a few steps need to be taken to use them in RobotBuilder.

Custom components all go in $USER_HOME/Robotbuilder/extensions. On Linux and Mac, $USER_HOME will be /Users/yourusername/. On Windows, it will be C:\Users\yourusername\
