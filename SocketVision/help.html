      <h1>Socket Vision over UDP</h1>

    <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p>
        This module acts as a sensor and provides a PID source that can be used
        within a PID Loop. This is useful for driving the robot to a target, aiming
        a shooting device, or determing position on the field of play.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Socket Vision sensor assumes that
        you are using a co-processor (ex: rasberry pi) that has
        a camera attached and is using vision processing
        algorithms (OpenCV) that will ascertain target information
        and then transmits that location / target data over a UDP socket.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of connectivitiy, the Socket Vision sensor acts as a client
        to the co-processor who acts as a server for UDP packets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the data is received from the co-processor, the targetting information can be extracted
        (ie: parsed) and manipulated to act as PID Source in a PID Loop or PID Command.
    </p>

    <h2>Properties</h2>

    <dl> 
      <dt>Server IP</dt>
      <dd>The IP of the co-processor that this sensor module will connect too.</dd>
      <dt>Server Port</dt>
      <dd>The port of the co-processor that this sensor module will connect too.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>What you have to do</h2>
    <p>
      In order to use this sensor, you will need to create a new class named SocketVision using
      the same Java namespace used in Robot.java. At a minimum, you will need a
      constructor, pidGet, and connect methods. Here is the minimum code you will need:
    </p>
    </br>
    <pre>
public class SocketVision {

  public SocketVision(String ip, int port) {
  }

  public boolean connect() {  
    return false;  
  }  

  public double pidGet() {
    // TODO: Fill this is with an appropriate value raging from -1 to 1.
    return 0;
  }
}
    </pre>
