      <h1>Socket Vision over UDP</h1>

    <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p>
        This module acts as a sensor and provides a PID source that can be used
        within a PID Loop. This is useful for driving the robot to a target, aiming
        a shooting device, or determing position on the field of play.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Socket Vision sensor assumes that
        you are using a co-processor (ex: rasberry pi) that has
        a camera attached and is using vision processing
        algorithms (OpenCV) that will ascertain target information
        and then transmits that location / target data over a UDP socket.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of connectivitiy, the Socket Vision sensor acts as a client
        to the co-processor who acts as a server for UDP packets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the data is received from the co-processor, the targetting information can be extracted
        (ie: parsed) and manipulated to act as PID Source in a PID Loop or PID Command.
    </p>
